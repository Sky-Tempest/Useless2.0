# Morse ➡️ Emoji Translator 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: CodeStorm.


### Team Members
- Team Lead: George Aloysious. - Albertian Institute of Science and Technology.
- Member 2: George Joseph. - Albertian Institute of Science and Technology.

### Project Description
A groundbreaking tool that serves no purpose. This project translates the beautifully antiquated language of Morse code into the equally fleeting and ambiguous language of emojis, creating a communication system that is, at best, a complete waste of time.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Morse code, once the backbone of global communication, is simply too… readable.
For years, people have suffered from being able to accurately interpret a sequence of dots and dashes. That ends now.

The world lacks a system that translates ".... . .-.. .-.. ---" into 🏠🥚🦁🦁🌊.
A problem nobody noticed—but we sure did.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Presenting: Morse ➡️ Emoji Translator 🎯
Our software proudly dismantles the efficiency of Morse code by converting it into vibrant, contextless emoji gibberish.

With absolutely no semantic accuracy, this translator:
  * Replaces letters with fruit and animals 🍕🐝
  * Confuses linguists and tech bros alike 🤯
  * Guarantees that no actual communication takes place 💅
Now, instead of distress signals, you can send dessert signals. 🍨🚨

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (the holy trinity of web confusion).
- Frameworks used: None. Because structure is for serious people.
- Libraries used: Zero. We handcrafted the chaos.
- Tools used: VS Code, GitHub, and blind optimism

For Hardware:
- Main components: Human fingers (for typing).
- Specifications: At least one functioning eyeball.
- Tools required: Keyboard, caffeine, a deep sense of irony.

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
None. Nada. Zilch.
We don’t believe in “setup” — just open the link and embrace the emoji madness.

🔗 Live Demo: https://your-live-url.com

(Works best on modern browsers. May confuse older adults.)

# Run
+ Open the above link.
+ Type some Morse code like ... --- ....
+ Watch it become 🐍🌊🐍 or something equally baffling.
+ Question your priorities.

No backend. No API. No dependencies. Just vibes.
